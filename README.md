# Athletic-Department-Web-Scraper

I created this web scraper to parse contact information from university athletic departments' websites. 

I noticed a pattern in the HTML code for most university sites, which made parsing emails and contact information  over several sites possible. This isn't a fullproof method, as some university websites are formatted differently. There is alternate code I made that can be used for those, but for what I am trying to achieve, this is the best solution I have come up with.
