# Athletic-Department-Web-Scraper

I created this web scraper to parse contact information from university athletic departments' websites. 

I noticed a pattern in the HTML code for most university sites, which made parsing emails and contact information  over several sites possible. This isn't a fullproof method, as some universities are formatted differently. There is alternate code I made that can be used for certain websites, but for what I am trying to achieve, this is the best solution I have come up with. 

If you would like to see the web scraping code for other university websites, shoot me a message.
